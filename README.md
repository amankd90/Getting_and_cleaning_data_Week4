# Getting_and_cleaning_data_Week4

This repository contains the following: 
1. run_analysis.R - this is the R script
2. Codebook to describe the variables 
3. tidy.text - a txt file containing the final data set

## Steps performed to create the final data:

 1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
